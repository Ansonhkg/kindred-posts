Automatically recommend your posts to your site visitors

== Description ==

Kindred Posts learns how your website visitors are currently accessing your site and uses artificial intelligence to recommend posts that your visitors may find most interesting. 

This easy-to-use plugin requires almost no setup and everything is set up so all you have to do is simply drag-and-drop a widget into your theme to start collecting statistics and recommending posts. As you get more adventurous, you can start tweaking how the widget looks and feels.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long after setting up the plugin does it take to recommend content? =

Once you drop the Kindred Posts widget into your theme, you and your website visitors will start seeing posts immediately. Your recommendations will become more targeted as more visitors navigate through your website and the plugin has had a chance to learn about how visitors access your website.

= What is Test Mode? =

Test mode takes all Kindred Posts widgets currently in your theme offline and feeds some fake data into the recommendation engine so you can see how the plugin looks to your visitors. While the plugin is in test mode, you can still collect data about how visitors are accessing your website and use that data to make recommendations once Test Mode is disabled.

= How do I activate the Premium version? =
